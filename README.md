# 🧠 DCGAN Face Generator using PyTorch (CPU-Friendly)

Welcome to the world of AI-generated human faces!

This project is a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** implemented in **PyTorch**, capable of generating realistic human faces using the **CelebA dataset** — **no GPU needed!** 🧑‍💻✨

## 🚀 Why This Project?

🔍 Have you ever wondered how AI can create faces that don’t exist?

This project demystifies that by building a GAN from scratch and training it on thousands of celebrity faces. You’ll see how a random vector of numbers can morph into a completely new human face — pixel by pixel!

## 📸 Sample Output

> Once training completes, generated faces will be shown **inside the notebook** using matplotlib.
